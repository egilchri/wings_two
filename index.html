                        Merton Densher returns to England from a trip. The previous afternoon, he arrived by train at Euston station at five o'clock, having sent a wire to Kate Croy from Liverpool. She met him at the station. They went to the station's refreshment room and had tea at a corner table. Kate told Densher she had to be at Lancaster Gate by six o'clock to see her Aunt Maud. She arranged to meet Densher the next morning at the National Gallery.

The next day, they meet at the gallery. They sit and talk. Kate stands up suddenly and makes a comment about a picture. Densher remarks on the stuffiness of the room and suggests they go outside. As they move to another part of the gallery, they encounter a young American woman, Miss Theale.

Later, after having lunch with the American women, Densher and Kate separate from them. Kate then asks Densher to put her in a cab, and she leaves.

Densher takes a long walk by himself, heading north. He reaches Regent's Park and sits down on a bench. He recalls asking Kate earlier if her Aunt Maud (Mrs. Lowder) knew of his return. Kate had replied that she did not, but said she would speak to her that night and arrange for Densher to visit. After a while, Densher gets up from the bench and resumes his walk.

<p class="calibre5">"I say, you know, Kate&mdash;you did stay!" had been
Merton Densher's punctual remark on their adventure
after they had, as it were, got out of it; an observation
which she not less promptly, on her side, let
him see that she forgave in him only because he was a
man. She had to recognise, with whatever disappointment,
that it was doubtless the most helpful he could
make in this character. The fact of the adventure
was flagrant between them; they had looked at each
other, on gaining the street, as people look who have
just rounded together a dangerous corner, and there
was therefore already enough unanimity sketched out
to have lighted, for her companion, anything equivocal
in her action. But the amount of light men did
need!&mdash;Kate could have been eloquent at this moment
about that.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"You stayed, you know, Kate&mdash;you actually did!" Merton Densher had said, predictably, once they'd emerged from their experience. She let him understand, with no less immediacy, that she excused this observation only because he was a man. She had to acknowledge, however disappointed she might be, that it was probably the most useful thing he could say in that capacity. The reality of their shared adventure was obvious. They'd looked at each other, as they stepped onto the street, the way people do after narrowly avoiding disaster. There was already enough shared understanding between them to illuminate, for him, the ambiguous nature of her actions. And how much illumination men seemed to require! Kate could have been quite expressive on that topic right now.</i></p></div>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">What, however, on his seeing more,
struck him as most distinct in her was her sense that,
reunited after his absence and having been now half
the morning together, it behooved them to face without
delay the question of handling their immediate
future. That it would require some handling, that
they should still have to deal, deal in a crafty manner,
with difficulties and delays, was the great matter he
had come back to, greater than any but the refreshed
consciousness of their personal need of each other. This need had had twenty minutes, the afternoon
before, to find out where it stood, and the time was
fully accounted for by the charm of the demonstration. He had arrived at Euston at five, having wired
her from Liverpool the moment he landed, and she
had quickly decided to meet him at the station, whatever
publicity might attend such an act.</p>

praised her for it on alighting from his train she had
answered frankly enough that such things should be
taken at a jump. She didn't care to-day who saw her,
and she profited by it for her joy. To-morrow, inevitably,
she should have time to think and then, as inevitably,
would become a baser creature, a creature of
alarms and precautions. It was none the less for to-morrow

would know them; just as, for that matter, now, in
the refreshment-room to which they had adjourned,

it actually rather smote him, for want of preparation

<p class="calibre5">His absence from her for so many weeks had had such
an effect upon him that his demands, his desires had
grown; and only the night before, as his ship steamed,
beneath summer stars, in sight of the Irish coast, he
had felt all the force of his particular necessity. He
hadn't in other words at any point doubted he was
on his way to say to her that really their mistake must
end. Their mistake was to have believed that they
could hold out&mdash;hold out, that is, not against Aunt
Maud, but against an impatience that, prolonged and
exasperated, made a man ill. He had known more
than ever, on their separating in the court of the station,
how ill a man, and even a woman, could feel
from such a cause; but he struck himself as also knowing
that he had already suffered Kate to begin finely
to apply antidotes and remedies and subtle sedatives.</p>

still, under her grasping hand, as she had held him in
their yearning interval, was a sort of thing that he
must allow her to have no quarrel about; but that

These meetings might, in other words, occur at her home, removing them even further from the public eye. That was a coherent explanation.

                    <div class="summary-content">
                        On a Thursday, Kate meets with Densher. She explains that they cannot meet at the house of the American ladies because the ladies are accountable to her Aunt Maud. Densher says their situation is unworkable and must end. Kate tells him that Milly Theale, one of the American ladies, likes him and that he should "make something of that."

Densher asks Kate if she will take him "just as I am." He then takes hold of her and asks repeatedly if she loves him. She closes her eyes, and they share a long embrace. Afterward, they continue to discuss their situation. Densher calls their need to be secretive a "game." Kate asks him to leave the planning to her and embraces him again.

After the second embrace, Densher agrees to her plan. Kate tells him that Milly is in love with him and will help them because she knows Aunt Maud opposes their relationship. She urges him to visit Milly. Densher questions this, and Kate reveals that Milly does not know that Kate cares for him. Kate explains that she and Milly have never spoken of him, and that Aunt Maud pretends their relationship does not exist.

Kate reminds Densher he has to leave. He asks where they can meet, and she again tells him to visit Milly, promising to meet him there. When he asks how they will get privacy, she tells him to "try it and you'll see." Densher asks Kate why she will not come to his rooms. She deflects the question. He then asks if her plan is to make Milly believe that Kate hates him. Becoming impatient, Kate ends the discussion. She signals for him to open the door and walks with him to the stairs, telling him not to spoil what she sees.

<p class="calibre5">It was extraordinary enough that he should actually
be finding himself, when Thursday arrived, none so
wide of the mark. Kate hadn't come all the way to
this for him, but she had come to a good deal by the
end of a quarter of an hour. What she had begun
with was her surprise at her appearing to have left
him on Tuesday anything more to understand. The
parts, as he now saw, under her hand, did fall more or
less together, and it wasn't even as if she had spent
the interval in twisting and fitting them.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">It was remarkable that by Thursday he wasn't completely off base. Kate hadn't come all this way just for him, but she had achieved a great deal within fifteen minutes. Her initial reaction was surprise that he had needed anything more explained to him after Tuesday. As he now understood, under her guidance the pieces did more or less align, and it wasn't as though she had spent the time contorting or adjusting them.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">She was
bright and handsome, not fagged and worn, with the
general clearness; for it certainly stuck out enough
that if the American ladies themselves weren't to be
squared, which was absurd, they fairly imposed the
necessity of trying Aunt Maud again. One couldn't
say to them, kind as she had been to them: "We'll
meet, please, whenever you'll let us, at your house;
but we count on you to help us to keep it secret."
They must in other terms inevitably speak to Aunt
Maud&mdash;it would be of the last awkwardness to ask
them not to: Kate had embraced all this in her choice
of speaking first. What Kate embraced altogether
was indeed wonderful to-day for Densher, though he
perhaps struck himself rather as getting it out of her
piece by piece than as receiving it in a steady light. He had always felt, however, that the more he asked
of her the more he found her prepared, as he imaged
it, to hand out.</p>

<p class="calibre5">He had said to her more than once
even before his absence: "You keep the key of the
cupboard, and I foresee that when we're married
you'll dole me out my sugar by lumps." She had replied
that she rejoiced in his assumption that sugar
would be his diet, and the domestic arrangement so
prefigured might have seemed already to prevail. The
supply from the cupboard at this hour was doubtless,
of a truth, not altogether cloyingly sweet; but it met
in a manner his immediate requirements. If her explanations
at any rate prompted questions the questions
no more exhausted them than they exhausted
her patience. And they were naturally, of the series,
the simpler; as for instance in his taking it from her
that Miss Theale then could do nothing for them.</p>

The offerings from the cupboard at that moment weren’t, it was true, overwhelmingly sweet, but they satisfied his immediate needs. If her explanations, at the very least, spurred him to ask questions, the questions never wore them out more than they wore out her patience.

<p class="calibre5">He
frankly brought out what he had ventured to think
possible. "If we can't meet here and we've really
exhausted the charms of the open air and the crowd,
some such little raft in the wreck, some occasional
opportunity like that of Tuesday, has been present to
me these two days as better than nothing. But if our
friends are so accountable to this house of course
there's no more to be said. And it's one more nail,

<p class="calibre5">She started by expressing her surprise that she seemed to have left him with anything more to figure out on Tuesday.

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">"Ah but, you know, not too much!" She had an
ironic gaiety for the implications of his "this," besides
wishing to insist on a general prudence. "She'll

I can't very well tell her all."</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"Oh, but you know, don't overdo it!"

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">It was perhaps because he said it so gravely that

<details><summary class="calibre4">Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">Maybe it was the seriousness of his tone that prompted Kate to be amused again, in a way. Even so, she seemed to brighten. "You can't really 'tell' her anything, and that's okay. Just be nice to her. "</i></p></div>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">Please
her; make her see how clever you are&mdash;only without

<p class="calibre5">"Well, it's essentially the same." He continued, "Of course, I should thank Mrs. Lowder personally. I mean, for this&mdash;on my own behalf."

<p class="calibre5">"Then I can! Leave it to me." With which she came
to him under the compulsion, again, that had united
them shortly before, and took hold of him in her urgency
to the same tender purpose. It was her form of
entreaty renewed and repeated, which made after all,
as he met it, their great fact clear. And it somehow
clarified all things so to possess each other.</p>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">The effect

                        A man named Densher receives a telegram from Mrs. Lowder inviting him to dinner. He arrives at her home to find her alone. Shortly after, Mrs. Stringham arrives, also alone, explaining that her companion, Milly Theale, is ill. Kate enters the room, followed by two other male guests.

During and after dinner, the group discusses the absent Milly Theale and her social success. Mrs. Lowder tells stories about it, and the other guests contribute. They question Densher about his role in Milly's "discovery" in America. Mrs. Lowder asks if Milly was as successful in America as she is in London. One guest suggests Londoners have better taste. Mrs. Stringham objects, stating Milly was very popular in Boston.

Mrs. Stringham then turns to Densher and tells him he knows nothing about her friend. Densher defends himself, saying Milly was kind to him in New York and notes that Mrs. Stringham was not present at the time. Mrs. Lowder and Kate agree with Densher, and Mrs. Lowder jokes about what might have happened between him and Milly. Densher states he did not gossip about Milly and insists he is not an authority on her.

Kate agrees that Milly is not easy to know. She tells Densher that while he may have discovered Milly, the rest of them have "developed" her. Mrs. Stringham insists Milly has not changed. Kate concludes by telling Densher he must accept the new situation on trust, and he agrees. The dinner ends.

                    One afternoon, Gilbert found her seated on the terrace, sketching in a notebook. He approached her cautiously, as if expecting to be rebuffed. She looked up as he neared, and he saw a flicker of annoyance in her eyes.

"May I sit with you?" he asked.

Kate hesitated for a moment, then shrugged, gesturing towards the empty chair beside her. He sat, carefully avoiding any physical contact. The silence stretched between them, punctuated only by the chirping of birds and the rustle of the wind through the trees.

Finally, Gilbert cleared his throat. "I have been thinking about what you said the other day," he began.

Kate did not respond, continuing to sketch in her notebook.

"About… the things we talked about," he stammered, his usual confidence seemingly diminished. "And I wanted to…" He trailed off, struggling for words. "I wanted to understand."

Kate finally looked up, her expression unreadable. "Understand what, exactly?"

"Everything," he replied, his voice barely a whisper. "Everything you want."

freedom affected him as fortunate even though in

                        After men have coffee and sing songs upstairs, a young man, Densher, and a young woman, Kate, sit together in the drawing room and agree they can meet without causing offense.

Later, on a balcony, Densher and Kate sit together on a small sofa. Kate tells him they must interact to distract her Aunt Maud. Kate then informs Densher that another woman, Milly, is unwell and did not attend the gathering. She suggests Milly’s illness is serious and says Milly postponed a trip abroad for him. Densher repeatedly asks what is wrong with Milly. Kate eventually explains that Milly, who is very wealthy and has become a social success, is seriously ill but hides it well. She reveals Milly is seeing a prominent doctor, Sir Luke Strett. Kate asks Densher to befriend and console Milly for the life and fortune she stands to lose.

A man named Lord Mark arrives and Kate introduces him to Densher. Lord Mark asks about Milly’s health before walking away with Kate for a private conversation. He then joins the others on the balcony.

Kate returns to Densher. He asks about Lord Mark, and she confirms he is the man her aunt favors for her. Kate then tells Densher that she has explained her own unmentioned relationship with him to Milly.

Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud) and Mrs. Stringham reappear as the party breaks up. Kate tells Densher he must leave, then goes to speak with Lord Mark in a corner. Mrs. Stringham bids Densher goodnight. Aunt Maud stops Densher and tells him not to neglect Milly, mentioning her charm and immense fortune. She tells him that she and Kate will also travel abroad and that he can visit them there. She then reveals she has told "the proper lie" for him and now depends on him to "make me right."

After leaving the house, Densher stops on the street and realizes what Aunt Maud’s lie was: she has assured Milly, through Mrs. Stringham, that Kate does not care for Densher and that his affection is one-sided, thereby deceiving Milly.

<p class="calibre5">It was the blessing of a big house that intervals
were large and, of an August night, that windows
were open; whereby, at a given moment, on the wide
balcony, with the songs sufficiently sung, Aunt Maud
could hold her little court more freshly. Densher and
Kate, during these moments, occupied side by side
a small sofa&mdash;a luxury formulated by the latter as
the proof, under criticism, of their remarkably good
conscience. "To seem not to know each other&mdash;once
you're here&mdash;would be," the girl said, "to
overdo it"; and she arranged it charmingly that they
must have some passage to put Aunt Maud off the
scent. She would be wondering otherwise what in the
world they found their account in.</p>

                        A man named Densher calls on Milly Theale at her hotel to inquire about her health. He finds her at home, turning from a table where she was writing. He asks about her health, and she dismisses his concern, stating she is well. They talk, and he changes the subject from his activities to her experiences in London.

He asks about her future plans. She tells him she is going abroad for a few weeks but is vague about when she will return. He asks her to promise she will come back. During their conversation, Milly says she would return for her friends, including Kate.

A carriage arrives outside. Milly gets up, and they both go to the balcony to look at it. She then invites Densher to go for a drive. They go back inside, where a servant announces the carriage is ready. Densher accepts her invitation. Milly tells the servant they will leave in ten minutes, then exits the room to get ready.

While Densher waits, a servant announces Kate Croy. Kate enters, sees Densher, and he explains that Milly is preparing for their drive. The servant leaves. Kate says she will not wait for Milly. Before leaving, she and Densher talk. He approaches her and holds out his hands; she takes them, then he lets go. He agrees to do what she wishes. Kate goes to the door, tells him how to explain her departure to Milly, and leaves.

A few minutes later, Milly returns, dressed to go out. Densher tells her about Kate’s brief visit and departure, and Milly accepts his explanation.

                    "Oh, it's so nice," she said. "I do like it so."

"It's charming, isn't it?"

"Yes, and so much better than I expected. I hadn't imagined it, really&mdash;not as nice as this."

Kate smiled at her. "Then you were disappointed?"

"Well, you know," Milly replied. "I thought it would be a little cold."

Kate waited. "Cold?"

"Yes&mdash;a little empty. But it isn't. It's so full."

"Full?"

"Of everything. Of&mdash;of you."

Kate, at this, considered her own shoes. "Oh, I'm a dreadful bore."

"No, you're not!" Milly protested. "You're splendid. It's the others who are bores, but you're not. You're the one person here who isn't!"

Kate’s eyes rose to meet hers. "Who are the others?"

"Oh, the people, you know." Milly waved her hand vaguely. "The ones who are here all the time."

"The hotel?"

"The people who come and go, who are always coming and going. The ones who stare at me, or the ones I stare at&mdash;I don't know which. I'm afraid I stare at them; I think they stare at me."

"You stare at them because you're shy," Kate explained. "They stare at you because you're charming. That's the whole mystery."

"Do you think I'm charming?"

"Yes, I think so. Don't you?"

Milly looked, for a moment, almost embarrassed. "No, I don't."

"Then you should begin to. It's very simple."

Milly gave a little sigh. "I don't know about that. But I do know this is much better than I supposed."

"You mean it's more amusing?"

"Oh, much more."

"You weren't afraid it would be dull?"

"Yes, I was afraid it would be dull."

"Well, you must stay, then."

Milly turned, her hand upon the balustrade. "You think so?"

"I'm sure of it." Kate spoke with confidence.

Milly appeared to consider this. "Do you think I shall be here a long time?"

"As long as you like."

"That's just it. That's what I don't know."

Kate said nothing, but she looked at Milly.

"Do you know?" Milly asked.

Kate continued to regard her with a smile. "I'm always trying to find out."

him another face. This was simply the face of his
old impression, which he now fully recovered&mdash;the
impression that American girls, when, rare case, they

it was therefore scarce supposable that complications
had become so soon too much for her. His pretext for
presenting himself was fortunately of the best and
simplest; the least he could decently do, given their
happy acquaintance, was to call with an enquiry after
learning that she had been prevented by illness from

originally before him, the question placed there by
Kate, should so of a sudden find itself quite dislodged
by another. This other, it was easy to see, came
straight up with the fact of her beautiful delusion and
her wasted charity; the whole thing preparing for him
as pretty a case of conscience as he could have desired,
and one at the prospect of which he was already
wincing. If he was interesting it was because he was
unhappy; and if he was unhappy it was because his
passion for Kate had spent itself in vain; and if Kate

<p class="calibre5">That above all was what
came up for him&mdash;how clear an impression of this
attitude, how definite an account of his own failure,
Kate must have given her friend. His immediate
quarter of an hour there with the girl lighted up for
him almost luridly such an inference; it was almost as
if the other party to their remarkable understanding
had been with them as they talked, had been hovering
about, had dropped in to look after her work. The
value of the work affected him as different from the
moment he saw it so expressed in poor Milly. Since it
was false that he wasn't loved, so his right was quite
quenched to figure on that ground as important; and
if he didn't look out he should find himself appreciating
in a way quite at odds with straightness the
good faith of Milly's benevolence.</p>

The value of the project seemed different to him from the moment he saw it expressed in poor Milly. Since it wasn't true that he wasn't loved, his right to be considered significant on that basis was completely extinguished; and if he wasn't careful, he would find himself appreciating, in a way that was entirely at odds with integrity, the sincerity of Milly's generosity.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">There was the
place for scruples; there the need absolutely to mind
what he was about. If it wasn't proper for him to
enjoy consideration on a perfectly false footing, where
was the guarantee that, if he kept on, he mightn't
soon himself pretend to the grievance in order not
to miss the sweet? Consideration&mdash;from a charming
girl&mdash;was soothing on whatever theory; and it
didn't take him far to remember that he had himself
as yet done nothing deceptive. It was Kate's description
of him, his defeated state, it was none of his own;
his responsibility would begin, as he might say, only
with acting it out.</p>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">The sharp point was, however, in
the difference between acting and not acting: this
difference in fact it was that made the case of conscience. He saw it with a certain alarm rise before
him that everything was acting that was not speaking
the particular word. "If you like me because you
think she doesn't, it isn't a bit true: she does like me
awfully!"&mdash;that would have been the particular
word; which there were at the same time but too palpably
such difficulties about his uttering. Wouldn't
it be virtually as indelicate to challenge her as to
leave her deluded?&mdash;and this quite apart from the
exposure, so to speak, of Kate, as to whom it would
constitute a kind of betrayal.</p>

Within ten minutes of being in the room, this insistent pressure had grown to something he might have likened to the Niagara's currents, if it weren't so ridiculous to compare something so insignificant to something so monumental.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">A simple friendship between a clever young man and a receptive young woman could only go so far, but his experiment kept going and going. Perhaps the main reason it continued was that they hadn't said a word about Kate, even though Kate's influence had been the most significant thing that had happened in recent weeks. Densher had asked Kate for guidance the previous night, but he was surprised to see how little that request seemed to matter now. She had predicted how little it would matter, of course, but the reality looked different when Milly presented it to him.</p>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">This all happened very quickly, and in the next moment, he was trying to make Milly's words easier for her.

<p class="calibre5">"No&mdash;that's not the way. At any rate it isn't
hers," he smiled. He remembered, however, then
that an undue acquaintance with Kate's ways was
just what he mustn't show; and he pursued the subject
no further than to remark with a good intention
that had the further merit of representing a truth:
"I don't feel as if I knew her&mdash;really to call know." "Well, if you come to that, I don't either!" she
laughed.</p>

<details><summary class="calibre4">Translation</summary>
<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"No, that's not it. Or at least, it's not how she is," he said, smiling.

<p class="calibre5">The words gave him, as soon as they were
uttered, a sense of responsibility for his own; though
during a silence that ensued for a minute he had time
to recognise that his own contained after all no element
of falsity. Strange enough therefore was it that
he could go too far&mdash;if it was too far&mdash;without being
false. His observation was one he would perfectly
have made to Kate herself. And before he again
spoke, and before Milly did, he took time for more
still&mdash;for feeling how just here it was that he must
break short off if his mind was really made up not to
go further.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">The words he'd just spoken immediately made him feel accountable for them, even though he had a minute of silence to consider that they weren't, at their core, dishonest.

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">It was as if he had been at a corner&mdash;and
fairly put there by his last speech; so that it depended
on him whether or no to turn it. The silence, if prolonged
but an instant, might even have given him a
sense of her waiting to see what he would do. It was
filled for them the next thing by the sound, rather
voluminous for the August afternoon, of the approach,
in the street below them, of heavy carriage-wheels and
of horses trained to "step." A rumble, a great shake,
a considerable effective clatter, had been apparently
succeeded by a pause at the door of the hotel, which
was in turn accompanied by a due display of diminished
prancing and stamping. "You've a visitor,"
Densher laughed, "and it must be at least an ambassador."</p>

<p class="calibre5">But I wouldn't say she bosses me around." "No, that's not her style. At least, not as far as I can tell," he smiled. However, he then remembered that he shouldn't seem too familiar with Kate's behavior.</p>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">So, he dropped the subject and made a well-meaning comment that happened to be true: "I don't feel like I really know her, not truly." "Well, if you want the truth, neither do I!" she laughed. As soon as she said those words, he felt responsible for his own.

going out, so that he might prolong his stay; and
second that she had said she would go out with pleasure
if he would like to drive&mdash;that in fact there were
always things to do, that there had been a question
for her to-day of several in particular, and that this in
short was why the carriage had been ordered so early. They perceived, as she said these things, that an enquirer

a man of any taste, so engaged, so enlisted, would

                        After Kate and Densher leave them, Milly and Mrs. Stringham (Susie) face each other. Milly places a hand on her heart. She acknowledges that Mrs. Stringham has met with a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, and that she (Milly) has used their guests as a barrier to avoid discussing it. Milly asks what Mrs. Stringham thinks of Mr. Densher, and Mrs. Stringham calls him handsome. Milly tells Mrs. Stringham that together they must "see me through." They embrace. Milly states that she does not want to know what the doctor said, only that Mrs. Stringham will support her on his terms. Mrs. Stringham reveals that the doctor said she could help Milly, that he told her nothing dreadful, and that Milly should do as she likes.

The next morning, Mrs. Stringham goes to Mrs. Lowder’s house at Lancaster Gate. Upon arriving, she begins to cry, explaining she could not do so in front of Milly. After Mrs. Lowder dismisses a footman, Mrs. Stringham recounts her meeting with Sir Luke Strett. She says the doctor is interested in Milly, that Milly does not have the illness she feared, but that she has a different, unnamed condition. The doctor's advice is that Milly must be made happy, and she is to return to him in three months.

Mrs. Stringham and Mrs. Lowder discuss this prescription for happiness. Mrs. Stringham asks if Kate Croy cares for Mr. Densher. Mrs. Lowder hesitates, then states that Kate *thinks* she cares for him but is mistaken. She instructs Mrs. Stringham to deny Kate’s interest to Milly if asked. Mrs. Lowder then agrees to help facilitate a relationship between Milly and Mr. Densher, explaining that this will also help her own plans for Kate. She formulates a plan for Mrs. Stringham and Milly to stay a few days longer and meet Mr. Densher at dinner. Mrs. Lowder asks again what Mrs. Stringham thinks of Densher. Mrs. Stringham calls him charming, and Mrs. Lowder agrees.

                        Milly states her intention to visit Sir Luke Strett to thank him for his tolerance of her behavior. A meeting concludes after Mrs. Lowder laughs at a remark from Mrs. Stringham (Susie) about Merton Densher.

Later, Milly tells Susie that Sir Luke is only being easy on her because he pities her. Susie disagrees, saying he likes her. Milly asks Susie to "work for me" and embraces her. Afterwards, Milly does not give Susie an account of her visit to the doctor.

At the meeting, Milly thanks Sir Luke for his kindness. He tells her she is looking remarkably well. She says he has already done her so much good, but he replies that she is difficult to treat and must go away soon. She tells him she is leaving for the Tyrol and then Venice on the fourteenth. Sir Luke states that he also plans to be in Venice in October with his niece, and they will meet there.

He asks about her companions, and Milly confirms Mrs. Stringham and two other women will be traveling with her. She identifies one companion as Miss Croy and mentions Miss Croy has a male friend, Mr. Densher, who always follows her and will likely be in Venice. Sir Luke asks if they are lovers; Milly smiles and says he is, but she is not interested in him. When Sir Luke notes that they won't be four women alone, Milly states that Mr. Densher will not have come for her. She asks Sir Luke if he can help Mr. Densher.

As the visit ends, Milly stands and gives Sir Luke her hand to say goodbye. He tells her she is "all right," and she asks him to "keep me so." He offers to do anything he can for Mr. Densher. Milly thinks, smiles, and says there is nothing that can be done.

Eugenio has taken her companions away for the morning at her request, granting her solitude. Milly resolves to ask Eugenio if he can arrange for her to stay in the palace permanently.

When she returns to the main saloon, she finds Lord Mark waiting for her. His arrival in Venice was unexpected. Lord Mark explains that he came on an impulse from Carlsbad after Mrs. Lowder and Kate Croy wrote to him about her whereabouts. He expresses no interest in joining the others, and Milly realizes he came just to see her. She offers to show him around the palace, and he accepts.

<p class="calibre5">It had at least made the difference for them, they
could feel, of an informed state in respect to the great
doctor, whom they were now to take as watching,
waiting, studying, or at any rate as proposing to himself
some such process before he should make up his
mind. Mrs. Stringham understood him as considering
the matter meanwhile in a spirit that, on this
same occasion, at Lancaster Gate, she had come back
to a rough notation of before retiring. She followed
the course of his reckoning.</p>

They could sense a shift toward a more informed position regarding the esteemed doctor, whom they now pictured as observing, anticipating, and analyzing, or, at the very least, as being in the midst of that process before reaching a decision. Mrs. Stringham interpreted his actions as a careful contemplation, something she'd returned to noting, in a rather crude way, before going to sleep at Lancaster Gate on that same day. She was following his line of thinking.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">If what they had talked

thoughts taken off herself&mdash;it wouldn't do any
harm and might conceivably do much good. If it

working, they themselves, conjoined, could do nothing
to contribute to it&mdash;they would be in no worse
a box than before. Only in this latter case the girl
would have had her free range for the summer, for the
autumn; she would have done her best in the sense
enjoined on her, and, coming back at the end to her
eminent man, would&mdash;besides having more to show
him&mdash;find him more ready to go on with her. It
was visible further to Susan Shepherd&mdash;as well as
being ground for a second report to her old friend&mdash;that
Milly did her part for a working view of the
general case, inasmuch as she mentioned frankly and
promptly that she meant to go and say good-bye to Sir
Luke Strett and thank him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">On this occasion, she experienced one of her strangest, yet most profound, anxieties &ndash; the fleeting idea that if she pushed things too far, she might damage their relationship, maybe even diminish its worth. Going too far meant not trying to stay uncomplicated. He would likely come to dislike her if she hindered him, if she interfered with his way of showing kindness, which was undoubtedly important to him. Susie wouldn't hate her because Susie actually wanted to suffer for her; Susie had this noble idea that she could somehow benefit her.</p>

                        A silence falls upon a woman, Milly, and her visitor, Lord Mark, after twenty minutes in an elevated room. She sighs to him that she never wants to go down. He asks why not, and she explains that she no longer goes out. Lord Mark asks if she is not well. In response, Milly kneels silently at a window with her head in her arms.

When she speaks again, she evades the question and says she would like to die there. He laughs and suggests she has other uses. She tells him England is too much for her, and he suggests she buy the place she is in. She says she will try. She asks if he thinks it better for her to "have it over," which makes him look worried. He then brings up a past conversation where he offered to look after her. He asks again if she is in trouble. She tells him, "I'm very badly ill."

He asks what she is doing about it, and she says she is living. Lord Mark tells her she wants to be adored, proposes to be the one to do it, and asks her to believe in him. Milly laughs. To change the subject, she gives him a tour of other rooms. Downstairs, as he is about to leave, she tells him he should not have come to Venice for her, but for his best friend. He asks if she means Kate Croy. Milly says Mrs. Lowder wants them to marry and that he should pursue Kate.

Lord Mark says that Kate is in love with someone else. Milly denies this, saying Kate herself gave her word that she was free and interested in no one. He questions Kate's word. As he is leaving, a servant named Pasquale enters with a visiting card. The visitor, Mr. Merton Densher, is announced and is waiting at the top of the stairs. Milly says she will see him, and Lord Mark reacts to the name.

                    How painful it all was! And yet, I would not have traded those hours for all the riches in the world. As I walked, I recalled the scene of our meeting, the words that we had exchanged, and the things that she had told me. I wanted to relive them. I wanted to see her again, to hear the sound of her voice. I had to see her again! 

I began to walk faster. It was already late, and I had a long way to go. I arrived at the entrance to the park. The iron gates were closed, but I knew the way. I climbed over them, and, taking a hidden path, I was soon inside. The park was deserted. I could only make out the dark outlines of the trees.

<p class="calibre5">Not yet so much as this morning had she felt herself
sink into possession; gratefully glad that the warmth
of the Southern summer was still in the high florid
rooms, palatial chambers where hard cool pavements
took reflexions in their lifelong polish, and where the
sun on the stirred sea-water, flickering up through
open windows, played over the painted "subjects"
in the splendid ceilings&mdash;medallions of purple and
brown, of brave old melancholy colour, medals as
of old reddened gold, embossed and beribboned, all
toned with time and all flourished and scolloped and
gilded about, set in their great moulded and figured
concavity (a nest of white cherubs, friendly creatures
of the air) and appreciated by the aid of that second
tier of smaller lights, straight openings to the front,
which did everything, even with the Baedekers and
photographs of Milly's party dreadfully meeting the
eye, to make of the place an apartment of state. This
at last only, though she had enjoyed the palace for
three weeks, seemed to count as effective occupation;
perhaps because it was the first time she had been
alone&mdash;really to call alone&mdash;since she had left
London, it ministered to her first full and unembarrassed
sense of what the great Eugenio had done for
her. The great Eugenio, recommended by grand-dukes
and Americans, had entered her service during
the last hours of all&mdash;had crossed from Paris, after
multiplied pourparlers with Mrs. Stringham, to whom
she had allowed more than ever a free hand, on purpose
to escort her to the Continent and encompass her
there, and had dedicated to her, from the moment of

These qualities gave her a sense of virtue, a clear conscience, and a self-assurance that would later become invaluable. She understood with her sharp intellect the unspoken agreement they shared. She endured the same test as Milly's other silent supporter. She saw easily that for Milly to be candid was to betray insights, expressions of gratitude, and glimpses of the felt contrast between her good fortune and her fear&mdash;all of which would have undermined her carefully constructed facade. That was the point, Kate realized with wonder: to acknowledge was to trigger the avalanche. This was the same avalanche Milly was always watching out for, an avalanche that could be set off by the slightest of sounds. It was less likely to be triggered by Milly's own suppressed complaints than by the useless sympathy, the empty, helpless assumptions of others. With so much unsaid between them, their efforts to be honest had to retreat, as we've suggested, to a superficial reason&mdash;which was adequately represented by a shared delight in the absence of idle talk.</i></p></div>

With her sharp mind, she grasped the logic of their shared deception, went through the same difficult experience as Milly's other quiet supporter, and understood that for the girl to be explicit would mean revealing insights, gratitude, and a glimpse of the contrast she felt between her good fortune and her fear.

She endured the same hardship as Milly's other quiet confidante, and knew that for the girl to be open would mean exposing her perceptions, her appreciation, and a hint of the disparity she felt between her good luck and her fear.

With so much unspoken between them, their joint attempt to be honest had to fall back, as we've suggested, on a superficial reason&mdash;which was suitably represented by a shared joy in escaping the endless talk.

"Yes, get me an hour alone; take them off&mdash;I don't

the conception, hitherto ungrasped, of some
complete use of her wealth itself, some use of it as
a counter-move to fate. It had passed between them
as preposterous that with so much money she should

never before had he so much struck her
as the man to do that on occasion with patience, to do
it indeed almost as with gratitude for the chance,
though at the same time with a sort of notifying firmness. The odd thing, as she was afterwards to recall,
was that her wonder for what had brought him was
not immediate, but had come at the end of five minutes;
and also, quite incoherently, that she felt almost
as glad to see him, and almost as forgiving of his interruption

at the best, the end of a respite; one might like
him very much and yet feel that his presence tempered
precious solitude more than any other known to
one: in spite of all of which, as he was neither dear

Also, quite illogically, she felt almost as pleased to see him, and almost as forgiving of his intrusion upon her solitude, as if he had already been in her thoughts or acting at her suggestion. Somehow, at best, he represented the end of a break; one might enjoy him immensely and still feel that his presence diluted precious solitude more than any other person known to her: despite all of which, as he was neither dear Susie, nor dear Kate, nor dear Aunt Maud, nor, not even in the slightest, dear Eugenio in person, the sight of him didn't diminish her sense of the absence of her friends.</i></p></div>

                        Densher, disliking his hotel in Venice, takes his first walk alone after having spent the previous two days at Palazzo Leporelli, mostly indoors due to bad weather. During his walk, he emerges onto a traghetto (a ferry stop) and sees a "for rent" sign on the green shutters of a small apartment he once occupied.

He recalls recently being out with Mrs. Lowder, Mrs. Stringham, and Kate, when Mrs. Lowder publicly instructed him to leave them and return to Milly Theale at the palace. He obeyed and sat with Milly alone until the others returned for tea.

After leaving the palace, feeling irritated, he stands at the traghetto for fifteen minutes looking at his old apartment across the canal. Deciding to rent the rooms as a test of his will, he ignores a ferryman and instead walks a longer route, crossing the Rialto bridge. He finds the rooms are unoccupied, speaks with the landlady, and arranges to move in the next day.

That evening at dinner at the palace, he tells the group about his new rooms. His hostess, Milly Theale, asks him to invite her over for tea. He agrees to her request, but internally resolves that he will not actually host her there. He also recalls that he came to Venice because Mrs. Lowder had written to invite him. He continues to spend time with the group at the palace, having occasional private moments with Kate.

couldn't herself have told by what queer glare at him
she had instantly signified that. He at any rate gave
her glare no time to act further; he fell back on the

neither Kate, nor Aunt Maud, nor Merton Densher,

                        A man, Densher, asks Kate about Mrs. Lowder's (Aunt Maud's) opinion of their frequent meetings. Kate dismisses his concern, causing him to blush. Her tone softens, and she questions the value of their meetings. He replies that they are not enough, but more than Mrs. Lowder gets. Kate explains that Mrs. Lowder believes what she wants to be true and assumes her plans for them are succeeding.

Densher asks if Mrs. Lowder believes Kate now dislikes him. Kate says he could make her believe it. When he asks how, she tells him not by lying, but by praising Milly, another woman in their party. The conversation shifts, and Densher asks about Lord Mark's recent brief visit. Kate explains that Lord Mark came to Venice, proposed marriage to Milly, was rejected, and left immediately.

The discussion returns to their own arrangement. Densher complains that Kate expects a great deal from him but gives him no "proof" in return. He challenges her claim that she is risking anything in their plan. She grows impatient and asks what he wants her to risk. He replies that he wants to be loved and cannot continue without "help." He suggests they end the deception and "face the music."

Kate refuses, saying they have gone too far and asks if he wants to kill Milly. She says they have told too many lies. Densher denies having told any lies and threatens to leave that night. Kate tells him, "Then go."

As they walk on in silence, Densher suddenly grabs her arm, stopping her. He says he will tell any lie she requires if she will come to his rooms. She asks how and where. He explains that it can be arranged. Before she answers, she sees their companions&mdash;Mrs. Lowder and Mrs. Stringham&mdash;emerging from a lace shop. She tells Densher to take his hand from her arm. They walk side-by-side to rejoin the waiting group.

<p class="calibre5">Densher became aware, afresh, that he disliked his
hotel&mdash;and all the more promptly that he had had
occasion of old to make the same discrimination. The
establishment, choked at that season with the polyglot
herd, cockneys of all climes, mainly German,
mainly American, mainly English, it appeared as the
corresponding sensitive nerve was touched, sounded
loud and not sweet, sounded anything and everything
but Italian, but Venetian. The Venetian was all a
dialect, he knew; yet it was pure Attic beside some of
the dialects at the bustling inn. It made, "abroad,"
both for his pleasure and his pain that he had to feel
at almost any point how he had been through every thing
before.</p>

The place, crammed at that time of year with a cacophony of languages, Londoners from every corner of the world, mostly German, mostly American, mostly English, seemed, when the appropriate sensitive nerve was struck, to sound loud and unpleasant. It sounded like anything and everything but Italian, but Venetian. He knew Venetian was just a dialect, but it was like pure Attic Greek compared to some of the other dialects in the busy hotel. Abroad, it was both a pleasure and a burden that he had to sense, at nearly every moment, how he had experienced it all before.</i></p></div>

during other visits, through this pleasant irritation of
paddling away&mdash;away from the concert of false
notes in the vulgarised hall, away from the amiable
American families and overfed German porters. He had in each case made terms for a lodging more
private and not more costly, and he recalled with tenderness
these shabby but friendly asylums, the windows
of which he should easily know again in passing
on canal or through campo. The shabbiest now failed
of an appeal to him, but he found himself at the end
of forty-eight hours forming views in respect to a
small independent quartiere, far down the Grand
Canal, which he had once occupied for a month with
a sense of pomp and circumstance and yet also with
a growth of initiation into the homelier Venetian
mysteries. The humour of those days came back to
him for an hour, and what further befell in this interval,
to be brief, was that, emerging on a traghetto in
sight of the recognised house, he made out on the
green shutters of his old, of his young windows the
strips of white pasted paper that figure in Venice as an
invitation to tenants.</p>

a series of hours in a museum, though without the

that the lady of Lancaster Gate had addressed him
with high publicity and as if expressing equally the
sense of her companions, who had not spoken, but
who might have been taken&mdash;yes, Susan Shepherd
quite equally with Kate&mdash;for inscrutable parties to

was that he had, before the two others, as it struck
him&mdash;that was to say especially before Kate&mdash;done
exactly as he was bidden; gathered himself up without
a protest and retraced his way to the palace. Present with him still was the question of whether he
looked a fool for it, of whether the awkwardness he
felt as the gondola rocked with the business of his
leaving it&mdash;they could but make, in submission, for a
landing-place that was none of the best&mdash;had furnished

it by its least compromising name, would have to begin. Therefore its hour had now charmingly sounded. Whatever in life he had recovered his old rooms
for, he had not recovered them to receive Milly
Theale: which made no more difference in his expression
of happy readiness than if he had been&mdash;just
what he was trying not to be&mdash;fully hardened
and fully base. So rapid in fact was the rhythm of his
inward drama that the quick vision of impossibility
produced in him by his hostess's direct and unexpected

scaring him.</p>

<p class="calibre5">It then occurred to him that leaving wouldn't lessen his foolishness, but would actually make it worse, and that, above all, since he hadn't really "started" anything, but had only yielded and agreed, had been too generous in accepting and forgiving the starts of others, he had no reason to be too strict with himself. The only clear thing in this complicated situation was that, whatever happened, he had to behave like a gentleman&mdash;which led to the, perhaps, less impressive truth that complications could sometimes be made less boring by considering how a gentleman would behave. I must add that this question wasn't Densher's biggest worry.

The sole certainty in this convoluted scenario was that, regardless of the outcome, he was obligated to conduct himself as a gentleman. This, perhaps, less profound observation, hinted that complexities could occasionally be rendered less tedious by considering how a gentleman would act. It should be noted that this concern didn't occupy the forefront of Densher's mind.

                        A man, Densher, arrives at a palace at the end of the day. He learns from Mrs. Stringham that Milly will miss dinner but will join them later for a party. He and Mrs. Stringham talk alone for five minutes before Kate and Mrs. Lowder appear. He asks about Milly's health, and Mrs. Stringham tells him Milly is better and is saving her strength for the party, where a doctor, Sir Luke Strett, will be a guest. She encourages Densher to speak with Sir Luke.

After dinner, Milly comes down to the party, which is attended by several other guests. She is wearing a white dress and a long pearl necklace. As the party continues with music, Kate approaches Densher. He tells her that Mrs. Stringham said Milly is better. Kate contradicts him, stating that Milly is actually worse. She explains their plan is to make Milly want to live.

Densher questions how the plan can work if Milly is dying. Kate tells him he must propose marriage to Milly. He asks if the purpose is for him to inherit her money upon her death, and Kate confirms it, saying they will then be free. She then informs him that she and her aunt, Mrs. Lowder, are leaving for London in three days, and that he is to stay behind with Milly.

As they speak, Milly notices them from across the room and smiles. Densher tells Kate he will only stay if she agrees to come to him first. When she hesitates, he threatens to leave the next day. Seeing he is serious, Kate agrees to his condition.

<p class="calibre5">This colloquy had taken place in the middle of
Piazza San Marco, always, as a great social saloon,
a smooth-floored, blue-roofed chamber of amenity,
favourable to talk; or rather, to be exact, not in the
middle, but at the point where our pair had paused
by a common impulse after leaving the great mosque-like
church. It rose now, domed and pinnacled, but
a little way behind them, and they had in front the
vast empty space, enclosed by its arcades, to which at
that hour movement and traffic were mostly confined. Venice was at breakfast, the Venice of the
visitor and the possible acquaintance, and, except
for the parties of importunate pigeons picking up the
crumbs of perpetual feasts, their prospect was clear
and they could see their companions hadn't yet been,
and weren't for a while longer likely to be, disgorged
by the lace-shop, in one of the loggie, where, shortly
before, they had left them for a look-in&mdash;the expression
was artfully Densher's&mdash;at Saint Mark's. Their morning had happened to take such a turn as

It loomed now, crowned with domes and spires, though set a little distance behind them, and they had before them the expansive, empty space, bordered by its arcades, where, at that hour, activity and movement were mostly concentrated. Venice was at breakfast, the Venice of the tourist and the potential acquaintance, and, save for the flocks of persistent pigeons pecking at the remains of constant meals, their view was unobstructed and they could see their companions hadn't yet emerged, and wouldn't for some time be likely to emerge, from the lace shop in one of the loggias, where, moments before, they'd left them for a peek&mdash;the phrase was Densher's crafty way of putting it&mdash;at Saint Mark's.

said of their general opportunity was that it was essentially
in presence&mdash;in presence of every one; every

proof how, even in presence, the opportunity could
become special was furnished precisely by this view
of the compatibility of their comfort with a certain
amount of lingering. The others had assented to
their not waiting in the shop; it was of course the

them this morning was the fact that, on his turning

Densher had by this time dedicated a corner of his mind to Susan Shepherd's deliberate interference; something that had begun for them at Lancaster Gate was now a feeling that had taken shape; her actions, exquisitely subtle, had a way of affecting him, mostly subtly, even when not obviously, in his own favor. They weren't truly united as a couple, as a "team"; there were too many people, at least three, and too many complications between them; but in the meantime, something was developing that would draw them closer.</p>

Densher had, by this point, devoted a portion of his thoughts to Susan Shepherd's intentional meddling. A vague unease that had started at Lancaster Gate had crystallized into something more substantial. Her exquisitely delicate maneuvers had a way of influencing him, often subtly, even when it wasn't immediately apparent, and usually to his benefit. They weren't a true couple, not a cohesive unit. Too many other people, at least three, and too many complexities stood between them. But in the meantime, a connection was forming that would pull them nearer.</i></p></div>

                        After some people have left, a man remains in his rooms, which are filled with the memory of a woman named Kate, who visited him there once. His plan, which she had accepted, has succeeded. He avoids all visitors but leaves his rooms to go to a palace, where he spends time with another woman, Milly, each day. Kate had required him to remain near Milly.

One evening, Milly asks him why he is staying. He does not answer immediately and leaves an hour later. He considers the explanation Kate would have given Milly: that he is staying to show her aunt, Mrs. Lowder, that he can live away from London and Kate.

During a later conversation, to explain why he is staying, he tells Milly that he wants to write a book. Milly becomes interested and says he will need his days free for writing. She then reminds him that she and another woman, "Susie," plan to visit him for tea. The man decides he will not allow the visit and asks Milly if it is safe for her to leave her house. Milly reacts negatively to his question, and he realizes he has made a mistake she had previously warned him against.

Milly tells him she wants to live and asks why she cannot visit him if doing so will help. He agrees she can come whenever she likes. Milly misinterprets his subsequent change in manner, believing he wants to leave to get away from her. The man says he will not go, and Milly responds that she will not go either, thereby cancelling her visit to his rooms.

She brings up his book again, and he says he is not writing one. She asks why he is staying, then answers her own question by stating he has to stay. He agrees. He understands that she believes he is waiting for permission from Kate's aunt. To counter this, he asks if staying for Milly herself isn't reason enough. He then stands up to leave and tells her that as long as he stays, she must think of him as "judging."

to her that evening, and with further ground for it,
the next sharpest question that had been on his lips
in the morning&mdash;which his other preoccupation had
then, to his consciousness, crowded out. His opportunity
was again made, as befell, by his learning from
Mrs. Stringham, on arriving, as usual, with the close
of day, at the palace, that Milly must fail them again
at dinner, but would to all appearance be able to come
down later. He had found Susan Shepherd alone in
the great saloon, where even more candles than their
friend's large common allowance&mdash;she grew daily
more splendid; they were all struck with it and chaffed
her about it&mdash;lighted up the pervasive mystery of

Lancaster Gate&mdash;having by that time arrived; and
with this call on her attention, the further call of her
musicians ushered by Eugenio, but personally and
separately welcomed, and the supreme opportunity

hadn't yet had occasion&mdash;circulating with a clearness

almost monastic, her hitherto inveterate black. Much

                        After leaving a woman, a man walks to a café instead of going home. He sits there motionless for three hours, drinking and smoking cigarettes. He decides his plan is to remain still and do nothing.

For the next three weeks, he adheres to this plan. After more than twenty days have passed, he goes to the woman's palace at tea-time but is told by a gondolier that she is not receiving visitors. He sends for a servant named Eugenio, who meets him in a gallery. Eugenio tells him the ladies are a "leetle" fatigued. Eugenio then escorts him to the door, and they do not speak of him returning.

The man walks through the stormy weather to the Piazza. He walks around the arcade three times before stopping in front of Florian's café, where he sees an acquaintance, Lord Mark, sitting at a table. Lord Mark turns his head and they look at each other, but they do not acknowledge one another. The man resumes walking. He circles the arcade again twice and sees Lord Mark still there. On his next pass, Lord Mark is gone.

The man stays away from the palace for three days. He paces in his rooms, watching for a messenger, but no note comes. When he goes out, he walks around the Square, checking the cafés. On the afternoon of the third day, his landlady opens the door and shows in a visitor, Mrs. Stringham, who is wet from the rain.

old rooms. He had recovered from the first a part of
his attachment to this scene of contemplation, within

side of that arch of associations and the left going up
the Canal; he had seen it in a particular light, to
which, more and more, his mind and his hands adjusted

from which&mdash;if relief was the name&mdash;he could

obsession importunate to all his senses; it lived again,
as a cluster of pleasant memories, at every hour and

outside to interfere. Never was a consciousness more
rounded and fastened down over what filled it; which
is precisely what we have spoken of as, in its degree,
the oppression of success, the somewhat chilled state&mdash;tending

Never had a mind been more completely focused on its contents. This is exactly what we have described as, in a way, the burden of achievement, the somewhat cold, isolating condition of ultimate recognition.

given her his word of honour that if she would come

beauty, and straight in the white face of his young
hostess, divine in her trust, or at any rate inscrutable
in her mercy&mdash;what it implied was that he should
lie with his lips. The single thing, of all things, that

                        A woman, later identified as Mrs. Susan Stringham, arrives to speak with a man named Densher. She tells him another woman is worse and has "turned her face to the wall." Densher waves away a servant who offers to take Mrs. Stringham's coat.

Mrs. Stringham says she does not know how the sick woman is, which is why she has come. She asks if Densher has been wretched; he replies that he has been still for three days, and she agrees this was the best course. She asks him not to leave, and he agrees to stay for her. She says anything he does for her is also for the sick woman. Densher asks if the woman is dying.

Mrs. Stringham says the sick woman has not mentioned Densher's name in three days, as if he were dead. Densher replies that he is dead, and Mrs. Stringham says she is too. Densher asks again if the woman is dying, and Mrs. Stringham asks if he knows. He says he does, and she confirms she knows as well, but "not everything." He helps her take off her cloak, and she sits down, again stating that the sick woman has "turned her face to the wall."

She reports that the woman does not speak of anyone and is "grim," which is unlike her. Densher asks if the woman hates him; Mrs. Stringham says she does not know. He asks if the sick woman would see him again. When Mrs. Stringham asks if he would like to see her in her current state, he says no. She then says it is too late.

Mrs. Stringham says there is one thing he can do. Densher asks about the doctor, Sir Luke Strett. Mrs. Stringham reports that she has wired Sir Luke, who will arrive on Thursday. They discuss their past positive interactions with Sir Luke. Densher states that he and Sir Luke never spoke of the sick woman.

Mrs. Stringham asks Densher if he will deny what the sick woman has been made to believe if Sir Luke asks him to. When Densher asks what he must deny, she tells him to deny what Lord Mark told her. She reveals that Lord Mark told the sick woman that Densher has been engaged to Miss Croy (Kate) the entire time.

Densher and Mrs. Stringham discuss Lord Mark, agreeing he came for "exasperation" after being humiliated and rejected by the sick woman months earlier. They conclude he knew she was dying and acted out of spite. Densher deduces that Lord Mark must have proposed to Kate, been refused, and came to Venice for an explanation, believing Densher was the reason for the refusal. Densher learns from Mrs. Stringham that Mrs. Lowder has written about Lord Mark's improving chances with Kate, and that Kate has not written to the sick woman.

Mrs. Stringham repeats her question: If Sir Luke asks, will Densher deny what the woman believes? Densher asks if Mrs. Stringham is certain the woman believes it, and she tells him to judge. He then asks if Mrs. Stringham herself believes it. She replies that her belief depends on his action and that she will believe his denial if he makes it. He asks what exactly he is to deny, and she answers, "Of everything." Densher moans.

his campi with gothic arches, to a small and comparatively

the acceptance of his position took sharper effect

him after all no wrong. It was his own fault if the vulgar
view, the view that might have been taken of an
inferior man, happened so incorrigibly to fit him. He

could only be there, he knew, to be received afresh;
and that&mdash;one had but to think of it&mdash;would be

                        On a Thursday, as the weather improves from a storm to sunshine, a man named Densher goes to the train station to meet Sir Luke Strett. He arrives early and paces the platform.

When the train arrives, Densher approaches Sir Luke's compartment. Sir Luke does not appear to recognize him at first, but then does. Outside the station, a servant named Eugenio is waiting with a gondola. Densher refuses a seat in the gondola, telling Sir Luke, "I don't go there now." Sir Luke says, "Oh," and departs in the gondola. Densher watches it leave, stands for a while, and then walks away.

For the next few days, Densher waits in his lodgings. After several days, Sir Luke visits him. They spend the following days together until Saturday, walking around Venice, looking at art, visiting shops, and sitting at cafés. They do not mention Milly.

On Saturday morning, Densher goes to the station to see Sir Luke off. Eugenio is also present. As Sir Luke is about to depart, he tells Densher he will return within the month. He then delivers a message from Milly Theale, asking Densher to go and see her. Sir Luke confirms that she is able to receive him.

As the train starts to move, Densher says he will go that day and asks, "Then she's better?" Sir Luke replies, "Yes, she's better." The train pulls away, and Densher remains on the platform, observed by Eugenio.

him, for honesty, looking at her. For honesty too&mdash;that

He had expressed, ten minutes earlier, his need to understand, and she was, after all, simply responding to that. However, what he was to understand was no small thing; it might be even more significant than it seemed. He took again one of his turns, not meeting what
she had last said; he mooned a minute, as he would

                        Merton Densher meets Kate at Lancaster Gate. Kate asks why he has not contacted her in the two weeks since his return. He explains he was following their "system" and avoiding haste. He arranged the visit by first writing to Kate's Aunt Maud. Kate had then wired him to arrive fifteen minutes before tea, which is scheduled for five o'clock.

Densher asks for recent news of Miss Theale (Milly). He states he has heard nothing, but knows Kate's aunt has been in contact with Mrs. Stringham. Surprised by his lack of information, Kate confirms her aunt has recent news. Densher asks if Miss Theale is alive. When Kate looks at him without speaking, he asks if she is dead. Kate shakes her head. He asks, "Not yet?"

He tells Kate that Milly is dying. He then reveals that Lord Mark visited Milly and told her that Densher and Kate are secretly engaged. Densher states that this news caused Milly to give up her will to live. Kate turns pale and asks if Densher could have denied the story to save Milly. He replies that he could not lie, as it would have required him to break his engagement with her. He also explains that Milly refused to see him for days after Lord Mark's visit.

Densher recounts that he stayed in Venice, and Milly eventually sent for him. He met with her for twenty minutes, during which she asked him to leave Venice and not wait for her to die. He left that same night. They discuss how Sir Luke Strett, a doctor, has returned to Milly's side, which Densher says means it is the end. Densher explains that it was Sir Luke who convinced Milly to see him for that final meeting.

As the clock strikes five, Kate prepares tea. She stands close to Densher and tells him they have succeeded, stating that Milly will not have loved him for nothing, and he will not have loved Kate for nothing.

Luke Strett, brought also blessedly an abatement of

bright colour, took large possession. Venice glowed

<p class="calibre5">They walked together and they talked, looked up
pictures again and recovered impressions&mdash;Sir
Luke knew just what he wanted; haunted a little the
dealers in old wares; sat down at Florian's for rest and
mild drinks; blessed above all the grand weather, a
bath of warm air, a pageant of autumn light. Once
or twice while they rested the great man closed his
eyes&mdash;keeping them so for some minutes while his
companion, the more easily watching his face for it,
made private reflexions on the subject of lost sleep. He had been up at night with her&mdash;he in person, for
hours; but this was all he showed of it and was apparently
to remain his nearest approach to an allusion. The extraordinary thing was that Densher could
take it in perfectly as evidence, could turn cold at the
image looking out of it; and yet that he could at
the same time not intermit a throb of his response to
accepted liberation.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">They walked and talked together, revisiting artwork and refreshing their memories&mdash;Sir Luke was decisive in his intentions. He frequented the antique dealers. He rested at Florian's for light refreshments, and above all, he appreciated the beautiful weather, a warm embrace of air, a spectacle of autumnal light. Once or twice, during their breaks, the older man closed his eyes, keeping them shut for several minutes while his companion, the better able to observe his features, privately contemplated the issue of lost sleep. Densher had spent hours awake with her, personally present during the night. But this was all he revealed, and it was apparently destined to be his closest reference to the matter. The remarkable aspect was that Densher could readily accept this as evidence, could be chilled by the unseen imagery it evoked, and yet, simultaneously, not lessen the surge of his reaction to the newfound freedom.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">The liberation was an experience
that held its own, and he continued to know why, in

everything, he had so fondly hoped for it. He had
hoped for it, had sat in his room there waiting for it,
because he had thus divined in it, should it come,
some power to let him off. He was being let off; dealt
with in the only way that didn't aggravate his responsibility. The beauty was also that this wasn't
on system or on any basis of intimate knowledge; it
was just by being a man of the world and by knowing
life, by feeling the real, that Sir Luke did him good.</p>

He was being absolved; it was being handled in a way that didn't worsen his guilt.

mattered and what didn't; he distinguished between
the essence and the shell, the just grounds and the
unjust for fussing. One was thus&mdash;if one were concerned

Densher's now complete detachment from the poor
ladies at the palace; nothing could have exceeded
the no less marked anomaly of the great man's own
abstentions of speech. He made, as he had done
when they met at the station, nothing whatever of
anything; and the effect of it, Densher would have
said, was a relation with him quite resembling that of
doctor and patient. One took the cue from him as

Nothing could have exceeded the equally obvious strangeness of the great man’s own silence. Just as he had done when they met at the station, he made absolutely nothing of anything.

                        Aunt Maud interrupts a conversation between Densher and Kate, who are standing by a fire. Kate and Densher separate as she enters. Kate speaks to her aunt and then leaves.

Over the following week, Densher has several conversations with Aunt Maud over tea. They discuss his recent experiences in Venice and speak of a girl named Milly, referring to her in the past tense. Densher tells Aunt Maud things about the experience that he has not told Kate.

One morning, Densher goes to a post office and sends a telegram to Kate. Later that day, he goes to a park and waits for her. Kate arrives. He takes her arm and they walk to a spot under a tree. He says they should get married the next day and announce it.

Kate questions him, saying they should wait. She then tells him that if he confirms he "knows something," she will agree to marry him immediately. Densher replies that he knows nothing. She says she would go home and announce the marriage that moment if he could give her an "idea" in good faith. After his appeal fails, Kate puts her hand on him and makes him sit down with her in a pair of chairs.

<p class="calibre5">"Then it has been&mdash;what do you say? a whole
fortnight?&mdash;without your making a sign?" Kate put that to him distinctly, in the December
dusk of Lancaster Gate and on the matter of the time
he had been back; but he saw with it straightway that
she was as admirably true as ever to her instinct&mdash;which
was a system as well&mdash;of not admitting the
possibility between them of small resentments, of
trifles to trip up their general trust. That by itself, the
renewed beauty of it, would at this fresh sight of her
have stirred him to his depths if something else, something
no less vivid but quite separate, hadn't stirred
him still more.</p>

But he understood immediately that she was, as always, flawlessly true to her instinct&mdash;which was also a strategy&mdash;of not allowing for the possibility of minor grievances between them, of trivial matters undermining their overall faith. That alone, the renewed beauty of it, would have moved him profoundly at the sight of her again, if something else, something equally intense but entirely different, hadn't moved him even more.</i></p></div>

their interruption had been, and that they met across
it even as persons whose adventures, on either side, in
time and space, of the nature of perils and exiles, had
had a peculiar strangeness. He wondered if he were
as different for her as she herself had immediately
appeared: which was but his way indeed of taking in,
with his thrill, that&mdash;even going by the mere first
look&mdash;she had never been so handsome. That fact
bloomed for him, in the firelight and lamplight that
glowed their welcome through the London fog, as the
flower of her difference; just as her difference itself&mdash;part
of which was her striking him as older in a degree
for which no mere couple of months could account&mdash;was
the fruit of their intimate relation. If
she was different it was because they had chosen together
that she should be, and she might now, as a
proof of their wisdom, their success, of the reality of
what had happened&mdash;of what in fact, for the spirit

days, so still, had been, he was quite aware, the
first point he should have to tackle; with which consciousness
indeed he had made a clean breast of it in
finally addressing Mrs. Lowder a note that had led to
his present visit. He had written to Aunt Maud as the
finer way; and it would doubtless have been to be
noted that he needed no effort not to write to Kate. Venice was three weeks behind him&mdash;he had come

pensioned, who had been paying her a visit and who
was within the hour to depart again for the suburbs. They were to have the scrap of time, after the withdrawal

time saw that, so far as telling her all was concerned,
she would be divided between the wish and the reluctance
to hear it; between the curiosity that, not
unnaturally, would consume her and the opposing
scruple of a respect for misfortune. The more she
studied him too&mdash;and he had never so felt her closely
attached to his face&mdash;the more the choice of an attitude
would become impossible to her. There would
simply be a feeling uppermost, and the feeling wouldn't

the quick forecast of her possibly breaking out

"What horrors are you telling me?" It would have
the sound&mdash;wouldn't it be open to him fairly to
bring that out himself?&mdash;of a repudiation, for pity
and almost for shame, of everything that in Venice had
passed between them. Not that she would confess to
any return upon herself; not that she would let compunction
or horror give her away; but it was in the air
for him&mdash;yes&mdash;that she wouldn't want details, that
she positively wouldn't take them, and that, if he
would generously understand it from her, she would
prefer to keep him down. Nothing, however, was
more definite for him than that at the same time he
must remain down but so far as it suited him. Something

Not that she would admit to any self-recrimination, not that she would allow remorse or horror to betray her; but it was palpable to him&mdash;yes&mdash;that she wouldn't want details, that she absolutely wouldn't accept them, and that, if he were to understand her generously, she would prefer him to keep it subdued.

<p class="calibre5">He even imagined her possibly exclaiming, if he revealed too much, with a shocked: "What are you saying?"

Not that she would admit to regretting anything, or that she'd let guilt or horror betray her. But he sensed that she wouldn't want the details, that she wouldn't accept them.

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">"To tell her he was lying?" "To tell her he was wrong." Densher was taken aback, gazing at her. The option Kate brought up was precisely the decision he'd faced in Venice, the one he had dismissed.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">"Of course we're still engaged. But to save her
life&mdash;!" He took in for a little the way she talked of it. Of
course, it was to be remembered, she had always

often before had moved him to admiration.</p>

that, and had had to take for answer that he was prepared
of course for everything. Wasn't he prepared

                    <div class="summary-content">
                        On Christmas Eve, something happens to a man in his apartment. After staying awake all night thinking about it, he becomes determined. On Christmas morning, he bathes, has breakfast, dresses more formally than usual, and goes out.

He walks to Sir Luke Strett's house. When he arrives, he sees a brougham (a carriage) parked outside, which causes him to stop. He recognizes the coachman and realizes the carriage belongs to Mrs. Lowder. He approaches the carriage window and sees Lord Mark, a man he recognizes from Venice, sitting inside. The two men exchange a look of recognition. The man turns away, walks up the steps of the house, and rings the bell.

Mrs. Lowder opens the door and dismisses the butler. On the steps, she and the man, Densher, confirm they have both received news of a death. Mrs. Lowder says her news came late the previous night and invites Densher to dine with her that evening. He asks if she will be alone, without Kate Croy. Mrs. Lowder explains that Kate left her house the day before to be with her sister in Chelsea because their father has shown up, causing a crisis.

After the conversation, Mrs. Lowder gets into the brougham with Lord Mark, and it drives away. Densher tells her he might come to dinner. When she asks if he is going to church, he says yes and turns away.

He walks south, deciding to follow Kate. He then stops, realizing he lied about going to church. Noticing he is near the Brompton Oratory, he walks to it and goes inside as a service is beginning.

                    The hinges were the problem, of course. They were old, rusted shut, and stubbornly attached to the frame. He tried the screwdriver, then the crowbar. He sweated, grunted, swore under his breath. The metal didn’t budge.

She watched him, her face illuminated by the weak beam of the flashlight, the shadows dancing across the walls. He felt her gaze, the unspoken question.

He took a step back, breathing heavily. "We'll need something stronger."

She didn't speak, just handed him the sledgehammer. It was heavy in his hands. He raised it, and brought it down on the door. The wood splintered, the sound echoing through the house. He swung again, and again, until the door gave way, collapsing inwards in a shower of dust and debris.

They stood there, side-by-side, in the doorway, staring at the destruction. The air was thick with the smell of old wood and something else, something metallic and sharp.

"Now what?" she asked, her voice barely a whisper.

He looked at her. Her eyes were wide, reflecting the faint light from the moon that spilled through the broken opening.

He didn't know.

<p class="calibre5">He was to remain for several days under the deep
impression of this inclusive passage, so luckily prolonged
from moment to moment, but interrupted at
its climax, as may be said, by the entrance of Aunt
Maud, who found them standing together near the
fire. The bearings of the colloquy, however, sharp
as they were, were less sharp to his intelligence,
strangely enough, than those of a talk with Mrs. Lowder alone for which she soon gave him&mdash;or for
which perhaps rather Kate gave him&mdash;full occasion. What had happened on her at last joining them was
to conduce, he could immediately see, to her desiring
to have him to herself.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">He would dwell on that extended conversation for days, experiencing a deep and lasting effect. The conversation, which seemed to stretch on indefinitely, was cut short, so to speak, by the arrival of Aunt Maud, who found them standing together near the fireplace. Despite the clear significance of their discussion, it held less meaning for him, surprisingly, than a subsequent conversation with Mrs. Lowder alone. An opportunity for this meeting was quickly provided, whether by Mrs. Lowder herself or, perhaps, by Kate. He immediately understood that Kate's eventual arrival meant she wanted to speak with him privately.</i></p></div>

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">Kate and he, no doubt, at the
opening of the door, had fallen apart with a certain
suddenness, so that she had turned her hard fine eyes
from one to the other; but the effect of this lost itself,
to his mind, the next minute, in the effect of his companion's
rare alertness. She instantly spoke to her
aunt of what had first been uppermost for herself,
inviting her thereby intimately to join them, and doing
it the more happily also, no doubt, because the
fact she resentfully named gave her ample support. "Had you quite understood, my dear, that it's full
three weeks&mdash;?" And she effaced herself as if to
leave Mrs. Lowder to deal from her own point of view
with this extravagance.</p>

<div class="translation-content"><p class="calibre5"><i class="calibre6">No doubt, as the door opened, Kate and he had separated with a certain abruptness, causing her to shift her sharp, refined gaze from one to the other. However, this moment’s impact faded quickly in his mind, overtaken by the effect of his companion’s uncommon attentiveness. She immediately addressed her aunt, speaking of the matter that was foremost in her own thoughts, inviting her warmly to join them. She did this all the more readily, undoubtedly, because the thing she resentfully mentioned provided her with ample justification. "Did you fully understand, my dear, that it’s been a full three weeks&mdash;?" And with that, she withdrew, as if to allow Mrs. Lowder to address the situation from her own perspective.</i></p></div>

<p class="calibre5">Densher of course straightway
noted that his cue for the protection of Kate was
to make, no less, all of it he could; and their tracks,
as he might have said, were fairly covered by the time
their hostess had taken afresh, on his renewed admission,
the measure of his scant eagerness. Kate
had moved away as if no great showing were needed
for her personal situation to be seen as delicate. She
had been entertaining their visitor on her aunt's behalf&mdash;a
visitor she had been at one time suspected
of favouring too much and who had now come back
to them as the stricken suitor of another person. It
wasn't that the fate of the other person, her exquisite
friend, didn't, in its tragic turn, also concern herself:

she needed no reminder that the scene precisely&mdash;by

absorbed him, the memory, the shadow, the sorrow

Milly's spirit had been after all so at one with her

                        A man, Densher, goes from a church to his club, where he sleeps for an hour. Before sleeping, he writes a note and sends it with a messenger to be hand-delivered to a woman named Kate.

At four o'clock, Densher knocks on Mrs. Condrip's door and meets Kate in the drawing-room. He is relieved to learn she received his note. Kate lights candles on the mantelpiece.

Densher tells Kate that Mrs. Lowder received a telegram the previous night from Mrs. Stringham about an "event" that had occurred, but that he himself has received no communication from Mrs. Stringham. Kate confirms that Mrs. Lowder told her nothing. Densher relays that Sir Luke will be back tomorrow. Kate informs Densher that Milly's trustee has already arrived to be with Mrs. Stringham.

Kate asks Densher why he went to see Sir Luke that morning. Densher says he will tell her but first asks if something bad has brought her to this house. He gets up and stands by the fire. She offers to help him with his trouble, and he admits that he is in trouble.

He explains that he received a letter. He says the postmark is recent, but he believes the letter itself was written earlier. He confirms it is a letter addressed to him in the deceased woman's handwriting, which he recognizes perfectly. He then looks out the window before turning back to Kate.

He tells her he received the letter the previous night and has it with him to show her. He then admits that he has not read it.

Kate asks how she can help him with it. Densher paces and then asks her to tell him what Lord Mark was doing with her and her aunt, and how Lord Mark knew that he and Kate were engaged.

the night to think of it he felt that what it most, if not

Strett, and yet that this step, though subordinate, was
none the less urgent. His prime decision was for another
matter, to which impatience, once he was on
the way, had now added itself; but he remained sufficiently
aware that he must compromise with the perhaps
excessive earliness. This, and the ferment set up

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">The situation, along with his inner turmoil, meant he shouldn't take a carriage. And besides, there weren't any cabs around in the dim, celebratory emptiness. Sir Luke's square wasn't close by, but he walked the distance without spotting a taxi.

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">But the complexity he'd felt was about to gain another component. When he got to Sir Luke's house, a brougham was parked outside, and that sight made his heart jump, causing him to stop momentarily. This pause was brief, but long enough for him to have a sudden understanding, which made him catch his breath. The carriage, perhaps Sir Luke's own at this hour and on this day, seemed like a sign that the great doctor was back.</p>

The carriage, as he got closer, belonged to Mrs. Lowder; the face on the box was the one he vaguely remembered from his comings and goings at Lancaster Gate, waiting outside. With this, the rest followed: the lady of Lancaster Gate, prompted by a reason not entirely different from his own, had come for news; and it was clear she was receiving news in the house, since her brougham remained.</p>

him within range of the window. It wasn't there he
had wished to see her; yet if she was there he couldn't
pretend not to. What he had however the next moment
made out was that if some one was there it

<p class="calibre5">The great glass at Florian's was a medium less
obscure, even with the window down, than the air of
the London Christmas; yet at present also, none the

could occur. Densher felt his own look a gaping arrest&mdash;which,
he disgustedly remembered, his back as
quickly turned, appeared to repeat itself as his special
privilege. He mounted the steps of the house and
touched the bell with a keen consciousness of being
habitually looked at by Kate's friend from positions
of almost insolent vantage. He forgot for the time
the moment when, in Venice, at the palace, the encouraged
young man had in a manner assisted at the

                        Kate rises and asks a man, Densher, if he is accusing her of telling someone a secret. He denies it but questions why Lord Mark is with Mrs. Lowder on Christmas morning. Kate explains that Lord Mark is staying at Mrs. Lowder's London house, Lancaster Gate, after having to rent out his own rooms. She further explains that Lord Mark stayed in town to keep her aunt, Mrs. Lowder (Aunt Maud), company.

Densher places his hands on Kate's shoulders, shakes her gently, and kisses her cheek. Kate then reveals that while Densher was in Venice, Lord Mark spoke openly to her, but she refused him. She explains that it was Milly who ultimately convinced Lord Mark that Densher was in love with her (Milly), a story Lord Mark then told to Aunt Maud.

Densher takes out a sealed letter and changes the subject, asking about Kate's father. Kate says her father is at her house, having arrived in a state of terror, and asks Densher not to question her about him. Densher then offers Kate the letter, which is from Milly. Kate notes it is unopened. He asks her to open it, but she refuses, guessing that it announces Milly has left Densher a fortune. After Densher offers the letter to her as a tribute, Kate takes it, turns to the fireplace, and throws it into the flames. They watch it burn, and she tells him he will get the official news from New York.

Two months later, after Densher has received a legal document from New York, he sends it to Kate, who then visits him. She arrives with the opened envelope. Densher tells her he had hoped she would return it to him unopened and asks for her consent to refuse the inheritance. He states he will not act without her consent, which forces her to choose between him or the money.

Kate then gives him an ultimatum: she will consent if he gives his word of honor that he is not in love with Milly's memory. Densher replies, "I'll marry you... in an hour... As we were." Kate turns to the door, shakes her head, and says, "We shall never be again as we were!"

<p class="calibre5">"It isn't so simple even as that." She had the air of thinking what it then might be. "I of course can't, with no clue, know what it is."

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">"I can't judge it until I know what you're talking about." It brought him then more to the point, though it
did so at first but by making him, on the hearthrug
before her, with his hands in his pockets, turn awhile
to and fro. There rose in him even with this movement
a recall of another time&mdash;the hour in Venice,
the hour of gloom and storm, when Susan Shepherd
had sat in his quarters there very much as Kate was
sitting now, and he had wondered, in pain even as
now, what he might say and mightn't. Yet the present

<div class="original-text">

<p class="calibre5">He
tried at any rate to attach that feeling to it while

for anything else, that she wrote&mdash;!" He dropped,
looking at her as if she'd understand. It brought him to the point, although it initially made him pace back and forth on the hearth rug in front of her, his hands in his pockets.</p>

Grand Canal. It was present then to his recording
consciousness that when he had last been driven to
such an attitude the very depth of his resistance to the
opportunity to give Kate away was what had so driven
him. His waiting companion had on that occasion
waited for him to say he would; and what he had

It struck his reflective consciousness then that the last time he’d adopted this stance, it had been the very intensity of his reluctance to betray Kate that had propelled him to it.

veil symmetrically and he had said she had better
take it off altogether, she had acceded to his suggestion
before the glass. It was just these things that
were vain; and what was real was that his fancy
figured her after the first few minutes as literally
now providing the element of reassurance which had
previously been his care. It was she, supremely,
who had the presence of mind. She made indeed for
that matter very prompt use of it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">"That I'm agreeing?" She solemnly shook her head. "No&mdash;because I see now. You'll marry me without the money; you won't marry me with it. If I don't agree, you won't."</p>

<p class="calibre5">"You'll lose me?" Though he stated it plainly, he showed a kind of reverence for her sharp understanding. "Well, you won't lose anything else. I'll give you every penny." His response was immediate and clear, but she didn't have a smile for him this time.</p>

<p class="calibre5">"Exactly&mdash;so that I have to make a choice." "You have to choose." Strange it was for him then that she stood in his
own rooms doing it, while, with an intensity now beyond
any that had ever made his breath come slow,
he waited for her act. "There's but one thing that
